# Project Vagabond

Project Vagabond was a group project done by:
* Rose Dimple 
* Bennett Williams
* Geo Joseph 
* Crickett Sykes 

> Project Vagabond is an application that is used amongst the traveling community. It was built with the intention of members posting/sharing their favorite locations across the world with their fellow travelers. Our client requested a clean layout with a user friendly interface that would allow sharing the joys of "vagabonding" to be a seamless and beautiful experience, an artform within itself. 

## Technologies Used 

The technologies that we used were:

* _Ruby on Rails_ for the backend 
* _React_ for the frontend 
* _Semantic UI_for styled components
* _Trello_ for task organization 
* _Heroku_ for web hosting our project 
* _Slack_ for group communication 
* _Github_ for version control  
* _HTML 5 / CSS 3_
* _VSCODE_ as our code editor

## Takeaways 
 
 > For starters, I think that the group project was slightly more difficult than we initially anticipated. However, while we struggled in many areas, we gained valuable experience and discovered strengths in others. I think from the beginning that we started off as a team wih a good sense of commradery. Early on in the project we spent an entire weekend day at a team member's home and grilled out while we programmed. I think that behaviors' such as this have valuable real world application when it comes to team morale and communication. We mobbed programmed that day and continued with this style for the remainder of the project. Each day we spent our lunches' together and made an effort to keep up with our enthusiasm. 
 > Some of the weaknesses that we discovered as a team were difficulty with delegating tasks. It would have been to our advantage to mob program in the beginning of the project and to seperate the tasks further into the project in order to get more accomplished. I think that we struggled with this due to time constraints as well as the novelty of a "group project" to each of us individually. 
 > Throughout everything I do believe that this was a positive experience for the group as a whole.
